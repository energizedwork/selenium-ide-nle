Natural Language Extensions adds behavioural driven development support to Selenium IDE, meaning 
tests can look less like

	open /fixture/setup
	assertTextPresent OK
	open /fixture/setupInvoice?reference=BSkyB-1&net=10000.00&vat=0.15&raised=03-Mar-09&settled=05-Mar-09
	storeText id invoiceId
	open /
	waitForElementPresent taxYearPicker
	select taxYearPicker 01-Mar-09 to 28-Feb-10
	waitForElementPresent invoicesTable
	waitForXpathCount //table[@id='invoicesTable']/tbody[@class='data']/tr[@class='selectable'] 1
	assertText //table[@id='invoicesTable']/tbody[@class='data']/tr[1]/td[1] 03-Mar-09
	assertText //table[@id='invoicesTable']/tbody[@class='data']/tr[1]/td[2] 05-Mar-09
	assertText //table[@id='invoicesTable']/tbody[@class='data']/tr[1]/td[3] BSkyB-1
	assertText //table[@id='invoicesTable']/tbody[@class='data']/tr[1]/td[4] £10,000.00
	assertText //table[@id='invoicesTable']/tbody[@class='data']/tr[1]/td[5] £1,500.00
	assertText //table[@id='invoicesTable']/tbody[@class='data']/tr[1]/td[6] £11,500.00
	click delete-${invoiceId}
	assertConfirmation Do you really want to delete invoice 'BSkyB-1'?

and more like

	initialise
	load common-mappings, invoice-mappings
	given an invoice DB-1 for £10,000.00 @ 15% that was raised on 05-Mar-09 and settled on 12-Mar-09
	when I open the home page
	and change the tax year to "01-Mar-09 to 28-Feb-10"
	then there should be 1 invoice in the invoices table
	and the 1st invoice should have a raised date of 05-Mar-09
	and a settled date of 12-Mar-09
	and a reference of DB-1

Getting Started
---------------
1. Download the Selenium IDE plugin for firefox and add in the following user extensions via the 
options menu

	test/selenium/selenese/core/scripts/extensions/actions.js
	test/selenium/selenese/core/scripts/extensions/uils.js

2. Open the following test suite

	test/selenium/suite.html

3. Launch the "Books" application from the shell

	grails run-app

The tests should all pass, and demonstrate what you can do with the natural language extensions.


Installation
------------
Unfortunately installation isn't straight forward - it's a case of copying the relevant files from 
"Books" to your project, fixing the compilation errors and URLs.

1. Copy the entire test/selenium folder to your project. 
	
2. Copy the entire web-app/js/naturalLangaugeExtensions. This must be served by your application, 
ideally on http://yourserver/js/naturalLanguageExtensions. If you can't serve from this URL then 
be sure to update test/selenium/selenese/core/scripts/extensions/actions.js accordingly

3. Copy 

	grails-app/controllers/uk/co/acuminous/test/FixtureController.groovy
	grails-app/views/fixture/index.gsp
	src/groovy/uk/co/acuminous/books/jbehave/**
	
You'll need to remove all references to the "Books" domain objects from FixtureController and TestFixtures. If the fixture 
controller isn't served from /fixture then you'll need to update more URLs in actions.js

4. Add the jbehave dependency from grails-app/conf/BuildConfig.groovy

5. Start adding your own tests to suite.html and adding mappings beneath js/naturalLanguageExtensions/mapping using the bundled examples for reference.
